# CONTENT TO DISPLAY

## Hero Section

**Title**: "Building the Human Layer for the Internet"

**Subtitle**: "An experiment in fighting bots with voice verification"

**Intro Paragraph**: 
"Soulmark is a Chrome extension that requires people to speak a few words from their posts to prove they're human. It's not perfect, but it's a start. Here's where we are and where we're going."

## Timeline Section

### Phase 1: MVP Launch âœ… 
**January 2025 - NOW**

**What we've built**:
- Chrome extension that works on X (Twitter) and LinkedIn
- Voice verification using OpenAI Whisper
- AI text detection using Claude
- Basic anonymous mode
- It works, mostly

**Real numbers**: 
- Active users: A few dozen friends testing it
- Daily verifications: ~100 when we remember to use it
- Bugs fixed: Countless

---

### Phase 2: Make It Actually Good ðŸš§
**Q1-Q2 2025 - IN PROGRESS**

**What we're working on**:
- Fix the jank (there's a lot)
- Make voice verification more forgiving
- Add rate limiting (before someone bankrupts us)
- Maybe a simple landing page
- Get 1,000 real users who aren't our friends

**Honest goals**:
- Don't go broke from API costs
- Get featured on Product Hunt
- Fix that weird bug where it sometimes doesn't work

---

### Phase 3: See If Anyone Cares ðŸ“…
**Q3-Q4 2025**

**If people actually use this**:
- Build an API so others can integrate
- Mobile app (maybe?)
- Add more platforms
- Figure out a business model
- Try not to get crushed by big tech

**Realistic targets**:
- 10,000 monthly users would be amazing
- One paying customer for the API
- Still existing

### Phase 4: The Dream ðŸ”®
**2026 - Who Knows**

**If we're still here**:
- Become a real verification standard
- Multiple verification methods
- Actual revenue
- Team bigger than just me
- Maybe acquisition, maybe we just keep building

**Moon shot**:
- 1M verifications per month
- Profitable
- Actually making a dent in the bot problem

## Current Status

**Where we're at**: Just launched, fixing bugs daily

**Real stats**:
- Total soulmarks created: ~500
- Platforms supported: 2 (X and LinkedIn)
- Team size: 1 developer
- Coffee consumed: Infinite

## Get Involved

**Try it out**:
"Install the extension and tell us what breaks. We need feedback from real humans using it in the wild."

**CTA**: "Add to Chrome - It's Free (and rough around the edges)"

**For Developers**:
"We're open source. Found a bug? PR's welcome. Want to help? Even better."

**CTA**: "View on GitHub"

**For Everyone Else**:
"Just spread the word if you think fighting bots matters."

# DESIGN SPECS (Keep the same beautiful design)

## Use the exact same design from before, just with honest content

All the beautiful CSS, animations, and visual design from the previous version - just swap the content for what's above.

The design is great. The bullshit metrics were not.

---

## Key Changes from Bullshit Version

1. **No fake numbers** - "15,847 verifications today" â†’ "~100 on a good day"
2. **Honest timeline** - Not "COMPLETED" when we just started
3. **Real goals** - "Don't go broke" not "10M users"
4. **Actual status** - "Fixing bugs" not "94% success rate"
5. **Human voice** - Sounds like a real person, not a pitch deck

---

Build this with the same love and attention to design, just with honesty instead of hype.
